# Poem Contributors to the Cool Poem Archive

If you add a poem to this repository, feel free to add your GitHub username to this list! If you'd like to add your real name and country you currently work in in parentheses after your username, feel free (but do not feel obligated to do so).

That way we can keep a running list of everyone who is learning about GitHub and Git and who creates a poem.
